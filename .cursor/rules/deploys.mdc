## Defining deployments

This repository is setup with deployment from Github to Oxygen. We do not need to run `shopify hydrogen deploy` as this will automatically run when code changes are pushed to the connected repository.

The "Deploy" workflow is simply adding files, committing files, and pushing to Github.
